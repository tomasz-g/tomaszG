	<h3>Hello,</h3>
		<p>
			My name is Tomasz. I live with my partner and a 2-year-old daughter in Roundwood,
			a beautifully situated small village, near Dublin. Currently, I'm working as a taxi driver in Dublin.
			I became very interested in computer programming just over 2 years ago, and since #1 'Hello World!', 
			programming has been my passion. I completed Fundamental of Computing Specialization at Coursea.org, 
			an eight-month programming course in Python and the annual Computer Science course 
			in Blackrock Further Education Institute (BFEI) in Dublin, where I learned 
			Java language basics, creating web pages using HTML5 and CSS and MS Office: Access and Excel.
			Ultimately, I would like to become a full-time programmer. At the moment, I continue developing my 
			Python skills and I am learning Django, the Python Web framework.
